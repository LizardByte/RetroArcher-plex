This folder is for the metadata agent only... everything needs to be compatible with python 2.7

Do NOT update idna. The latest version to support Python 2.7 is 2.10.
Do NOT update igdb, unless they accept this pull request (https://github.com/twitchtv/igdb-api-python/pull/7)
Do NOT update plexapi, unless they accept this pull request (https://github.com/pkkid/python-plexapi/pull/658)
Do NOT update plexapi... without fully reviewing differences (it doesn't support python 2.7 by default)

Before updating any of the submodules in this folder verify they work with python 2.7 AND test!
